\f0\fs24 \cf0 Update2 :\
		Continuing with the estimation of parameters for measurement of Score, we implemented another module along with the running time which computes unused variables of a program and efficiency of a program.\
			\
	So by these parameters we are calculating the code quality of program by giving weightage to the parameters, also we are working on to classify the types of programs or assignment Solutions based on machine learning techniques.So that we can categorise the programs based on analysing the data sets.  }
